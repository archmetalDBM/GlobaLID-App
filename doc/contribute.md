Many thanks for your efforts in extending GlobaLID!

# To prepare your submission

To facilitate the extension of GlobaLID, please make sure to use [this
template](../template_contribute.csv) (UTF-8 encoded, comma-separated)
and to follow these notations:

-   Names and titles in local script are provided in square brackets
    after the transliterated names wherever possible, e.g. `Egypt [مصر]`
    or `Zamthang County [壤塘县]`. This also holds true for names with
    letters close to the English alphabet, like `Hunsruck [Hunsrück]` or
    `Cevennes [Cévennes]`.
-   Multiple items within a field are separated by a `;` (semicolon),
    e.g. `Cu; Fe; Pb`.
-   Mineral names are never abbreviated.
-   Coordinates must be given in decimal degree according to EPSG 4326,
    these are the coordinates you get from e.g. GoogleMaps and
    OpenStreetMap.

#### The submission workflow

1.  Upload your data. Please make sure it is encoded in UTF-8 to avoid
    any problems with non-standard latin letters.
2.  Provide the correct information to parse your dataset (separator,
    decimal sign, quote).
3.  Fill in all other fields. They will depend on the type of the
    contribution:
    -   “New data”:
        -   Published material: Please provide a pdf of the original
            publication, its DOI (if available, otherwise “n/a”) and its
            full citation. Files larger than 25 MB cannot be submitted
            via the app, please send them to us by
            [mail](mailto:globalid@bergbaumuseum.de?subject=GlobaLID:%20pdf%20file%20submission)
        -   Unpublished material: This feature will be available soon.
    -   “Update data”:
        -   No further information is necessary.
4.  Please provide a short comment about the data, i. e. indicate what
    you updated, from which region the new data are etc. Please indicate
    here also any potential problems and ambiguities in the data. This
    will allow us to better organise the integration of your
    contribution into GlobaLID.
5.  Check in the tab “Data Viewer” if your data was correctly parsed.
    Double-check if everything is correct; typos must be avoided at all
    cost.
6.  Go to the “Check & Submit” tab and check if your submission is in
    agreement with the list. If so, tick the boxes.
7.  Finally, hit the “Submit” button. GlobaLID will roughly check your
    submission.
    -   You will get a confirmation of your submission if it was
        successful.
    -   If it was not successful, an error message will tell you which
        problem occurred.
