As a service provider we are responsible under general law and in
accordance with § 7 (1) German Telemedia Act (TMG) for our own contents
on this website. Pursuant to §§ 8 through 10 TMG we are not responsible
as a service provider to monitor transferred or stored information of
third parties or to research circumstances that suggest an illegal
activity.  
Obligations for the removal or blocking of the use of information in
accordance with the general laws remain unaffected. However, any
liability in this respect is only incurred from the moment that
knowledge of the specific infringement is obtained. Once a specific
infringement has been identified, we will immediately remove the
infringing contents.

Our site contains links to websites of third parties, on whose contents
we have no influence. We therefore will not accept any liability for
these third-party contents. The respective providers or operators of the
linked sites are always responsible for these contents. The linked pages
were checked for any possible infringements at the time of establishment
of the link. Unlawful contents were not apparent at the time of
linking.  
However, permanent checking of the linked pages in terms of content is
not reasonable without specific evidence of infringements. In the event
that infringements become known to us we will remove such links
immediately.
